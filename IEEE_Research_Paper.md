## Abstract

Brain tumor detection is a critical aspect of medical diagnosis that requires high precision and accuracy for effective treatment planning. This research presents an automated brain tumor detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. The proposed system employs a deep learning approach to classify brain MRI images into tumor-positive and tumor-negative categories. The CNN architecture consists of four convolutional blocks with batch normalization, dropout layers for regularization, and optimized hyperparameters. The system achieves a classification accuracy of 67% on the test dataset with a confidence threshold of 0.570. A user-friendly web interface developed using Gradio framework enables real-time image upload and analysis, making the system accessible for medical practitioners. The integration of mobile-responsive design ensures accessibility across multiple devices, facilitating point-of-care diagnosis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Brain tumors represent one of the most serious medical conditions requiring immediate and accurate diagnosis. Traditional manual analysis of brain MRI scans is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. The complexity of brain anatomy and the subtle differences between healthy and pathological tissues make automated detection systems essential for improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing analysis time.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Manual interpretation of brain MRI images by radiologists is:
- Time-intensive, often requiring hours for comprehensive analysis
- Subject to inter-observer variability and human fatigue
- Limited by the availability of experienced radiologists
- Prone to missed early-stage tumors due to subtle visual cues

### 1.3 Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. Develop an automated brain tumor detection system using deep learning
2. Implement a CNN architecture optimized for medical image classification
3. Create a user-friendly web interface for real-time diagnosis
4. Achieve reliable classification accuracy with minimal false negatives
5. Design a mobile-responsive system for point-of-care applications

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
- Binary classification (tumor present/absent)
- MRI image analysis in standard formats (JPEG, PNG)
- Web-based deployment for accessibility
- Real-time processing capabilities

**Limitations:**
- Limited to binary classification (not tumor type classification)
- Requires standardized MRI image formats
